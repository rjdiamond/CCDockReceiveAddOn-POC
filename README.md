# CCDockReceiveAddOn-POC
Adds a form button next to all csXs listed inside the dock received PO allowing you to open an 'inventory at' page in a new window.

Clicking on the form button will open a new window displaying the 'inventory at' location results.

Button added to all POs in docked received for credit capping.

This will eliminate the need to copy and paste each csX into the 'intenvory at' page.


Currently private, message me to request access.
