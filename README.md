# CCDockReceiveAddOn-POC

Adds a function button next to all csXs listed inside the Dock Received PO allowing you to open an Inventory At page in a new window.

Button added to all POs in Docked Received for use credit capping - eliminates the need to copy and paste each csX into the Inventory page.

Companion script to Inventory At autofill: https://github.com/rjdiamond/CCInventoryAtAutoFill-POC
